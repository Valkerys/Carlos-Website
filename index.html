      <h3>Knowledgeable coder</h3>
      <p>I love learning new coding languages and programs to see how I can solve problems.
        Figuring out how things worked and see if I can create something similar myself has always been something I enjoyed.</p>

      <h3>Adventurous</h3>
      <p>Getting to try new and scary experiences is one of my favorite things to do!
          Because of this, I have found passions, created memories and made life-long friends.
          I live by the words:</p>
          <p>Seek Discomfort</p>
